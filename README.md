# README
The [Break Overlap Calendar](https://dishamaheshwari1.github.io/college-break-overlaps/) is a **web-based tool** that displays a calendar view of academic breaks across different colleges. It allows users to toggle specific colleges on or off and **visually identify overlapping break periods**. This makes it easy to coordinate shared time off between institutions.
### Features
- Interactive calendar view for visualizing college breaks
- Toggle buttons to select which colleges to display
- Clear visual indicators for full and partial overlaps:
- Solid green: all selected colleges are on break
- Green stripes: some selected colleges are on break
